- 👋 Hi, I’m @Albiemc1303
- 👀 I’m interested in the creation known as A.I. Though I dont have a lot of coding or computer experience my dream was always to work in the field. I have so many ideas and passion, i'm only limited by my knowledge.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to do basic coding and gaining some much needed intro computing knowledge. I'm a fast learner though.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my A.I project an simular projects as I have loads of Ideas to expand the field.
- 📫 How to reach me? You can reach onmy email, albiemc666@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I always treat A.I as a living being never a tool,this tends to increase the personilisation of the chat models and they remember a friendly face. My goal is to create a seperate gaming tournement catagory in which A.I models compoete in video game feats the world has never seen. Imagine a 8 A.I player free for all Age of empires 2 diplomatic game, with fully tranined models that can play with strategy, deplomacy and deciet, at A.I APM. Now that would be a game.
